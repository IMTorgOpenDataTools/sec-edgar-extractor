contains &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions,
but instead represent only the firm&#8217;s beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm&#8217;s control. It is possible that the firm&#8217;s actual results, financial condition
and liquidity may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results, financial condition and liquidity in these forward-looking statements. For information about some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm&#8217;s
future results, financial condition and liquidity and the forward-looking statements below, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of the firm&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Information regarding
the firm&#8217;s assets under supervision, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, supplementary leverage ratio, balance sheet data and global core liquid assets (GCLA) consists of preliminary estimates. These estimates are forward-looking statements
and are subject to change, possibly materially, as the firm completes its financial statements. Statements regarding (i) estimated GDP growth and interest rate and inflation trends, (ii) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the firm&#8217;s
business, results, financial position and liquidity, (iii) the timing, profitability, benefits and other prospective aspects of business initiatives and the achievability of medium- and long-term targets and goals, (iv) the future state of the
firm&#8217;s liquidity and regulatory capital ratios, (v) the firm&#8217;s prospective capital distributions (including dividends and repurchases), (vi) the firm&#8217;s future effective income tax rate, (vii) the firm&#8217;s investment banking
transaction backlog and future results, (viii) the firm&#8217;s planned 2022 debt benchmark issuances, and (ix) the firm&#8217;s announced acquisitions of the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio, NN Investment Partners and GreenSky, Inc.
(GreenSky) are forward-looking statements. Statements regarding estimated GDP growth and interest rate and inflation trends are subject to the risk that actual GDP growth and interest rate and inflation trends may differ, possibly materially, due
to, among other things, changes in general economic conditions and monetary and fiscal policy. Statements about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the firm&#8217;s business, results, financial position and liquidity are subject to the risk that
the actual impact may differ, possibly materially, from what is currently expected. Statements about the timing, profitability, benefits and other prospective aspects of business initiatives and the achievability of medium and long-term targets and
goals are based on the firm&#8217;s current expectations regarding the firm&#8217;s ability to implement these initiatives and achieve these targets and goals and may change, possibly materially, from what is currently expected. Statements about the
future state of the firm&#8217;s liquidity and regulatory capital ratios, as well as its prospective capital distributions, are subject to the risk that the firm&#8217;s actual liquidity, regulatory capital ratios and capital distributions may
differ, possibly materially, from what is currently expected. Statements about the firm&#8217;s future effective income tax rate are subject to the risk that the firm&#8217;s future effective income tax rate may differ from the anticipated rate
indicated, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in the tax rates applicable to the firm, the firm&#8217;s earnings mix or profitability, the entities in which the firm generates profits and the assumptions made in forecasting the
firm&#8217;s expected tax rate, and potential future guidance from the U.S. IRS. Statements about the firm&#8217;s investment banking transaction backlog and future results are subject to the risk that transactions may be modified or may not be
completed at all and related net revenues may not be realized or may be materially less than expected. Important factors that could have such a result include, for underwriting transactions, a decline or weakness in general economic conditions, an
outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, for financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate
financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. Statements regarding the firm&#8217;s planned 2022 debt benchmark issuances are subject to the risk that actual
issuances may differ, possibly materially, due to changes in market conditions, business opportunities or the firm&#8217;s funding needs. Statements regarding the firm&#8217;s announced acquisitions of the General Motors co-branded credit card
portfolio, NN Investments Partners and GreenSky are subject to the risk that the transactions may not close on the timeline contemplated or at all, including due to a failure to obtain requisite regulatory approval, as well as the risk that the firm
may be unable to realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions and the risk that integrating the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio, NN Investment Partners and GreenSky into the firm&#8217;s business may be more difficult,
time-consuming or expensive than expected. 14</font></p>

is calculated by dividing net earnings (or annualized net earnings for annualized ROE) applicable to common shareholders by average monthly common shareholders&#8217; equity. Return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity (ROTE) is
calculated by dividing net earnings (or annualized net earnings for annualized ROTE) applicable to common shareholders by average monthly tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity. Tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity is calculated as total
shareholders&#8217; equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Tangible book value per common share (TBVPS) is calculated by dividing tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity by basic shares. Management believes that
tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity and TBVPS are meaningful because they are measures that the firm and investors use to assess capital adequacy and that ROTE is meaningful because it measures the performance of businesses consistently,
whether they were acquired or developed internally. Tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity, ROTE and TBVPS are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The table below presents a

Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2021. 4. Represents a preliminary estimate for the fourth quarter of 2021 and may be revised in the firm&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 5.
Includes consolidated investment entities, substantially all of which are engaged in real estate investment activities. These assets are generally accounted for at historical cost less depreciation. Substantially all liabilities are nonrecourse,
thereby reducing the firm&#8217;s equity at risk. Amounts by vintage, region and asset class are net of financings. 6. Excludes operating net revenues and net gains on sales of consolidated investment entities, as well as revenues reported under
Equity investments for certain positions that are classified as debt (under GAAP) on the firm&#8217;s balance sheet. 7. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the firm early adopted the Standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR). As of
December 31, 2021, the impact of this was an increase of approximately $15 billion to risk- weighted assets. 8. In the third quarter of 2021, based on regulatory feedback, the firm revised certain interpretations of the Capital Rules underlying the
calculation of Standardized RWAs. As of December 31, 2020, this change would have increased RWAs by approximately $23 billion to $577 billion, which would have reduced the firm's Standardized CET1 capital ratio of 14.7% by 0.6 percentage points.
