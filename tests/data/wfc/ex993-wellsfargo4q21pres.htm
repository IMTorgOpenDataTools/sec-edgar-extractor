<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">204Q21 Financial Results Tangible Common Equity Wells Fargo &amp; Company and Subsidiaries TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and  represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) and goodwill and other  intangibles on nonmarketable equity securities, net of applicable deferred taxes. One of these ratios is return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE), which  represents our annualized earnings as a percentage of tangible common equity. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among  companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity, which utilizes tangible common equity, is a useful financial measure because it  enables management, investors, and others to assess the Company&#8217;s use of equity. The table below provides a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to GAAP financial measures.

However, the requirements for determining total capital remained in accordance with transition requirements at December 31, 2021,  but became fully phased-in beginning January 1, 2022. The Basel III capital rules provide for two capital frameworks (the Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approach applicable to certain institutions), and we must calculate our  CET1, tier 1 and total capital ratios under both approaches. (2) In second quarter 2021, we elected to change our accounting method for low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments. We also elected to change the presentation of investment tax credits related to solar energy investments.  Prior period total equity was revised to conform with the current period presentation. Prior period risk-based capital and certain other regulatory related metrics were not revised. (3) Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at period end. (4) In second quarter 2020, the Company elected to apply a modified transition provision issued by federal banking regulators related to the impact of CECL on regulatory capital. The rule permits certain banking organizations to exclude  from regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of CECL, plus 25% of the cumulative changes in the allowance for credit losses (ACL) under CECL for each period until December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year phase-out of the  benefits. The impact of the CECL transition provision on our regulatory capital at December&nbsp;31, 2021 was an increase in capital of $239 million, reflecting a $991 million (post-tax) increase in capital recognized upon our initial adoption  of CECL, offset by 25% of the $4.9 billion increase in our ACL under CECL from January&nbsp;1, 2020, through December&nbsp;31, 2021. </FONT></DIV>
